            Airport Representative Office at Suvarnabhumi Airport offers
            patients and their families comprehensive healthcare services,
            including hotel reservations upon arrival and efficient pick-up and
            drop-off logistics. Convenience is another important factor at
            Bumrungrad. Patients from outside can receive the care they require
            and get back home faster thanks to the hospital's one-stop medical
            campus, which can offer diagnostic tests, specialized referrals, and
            treatment in a matter of days rather than weeks.Furthermore,
            Bumrungrad International Hospital has a one-price policy for all
            medical services; this means that patients, whether domestic or
            foreign, pay the same amount for care regardless of their
            nationality. No matter where they are from, Bumrungrad goes above
            and beyond to make sure that every patient is treated fairly and
            with care via compassion, comfort, convenience, and coordination.
            Bumrungrad means "care for the people" in Thai, for this reason.
